   - Completed features checklist
   - In-progress items
   - Pending phases
   - Repository structure
   - Quality metrics
   - Dependencies
   - Next steps
   - Timeline estimates

3. **TODO.md** - Updated with:
   - Current version header
   - Current phase indicator
   - Last updated date
   - Phase 0 marked as completed
   - All new tasks marked complete

### Code Quality ✓
Final checks performed:
- `go mod tidy` - Clean
- `go fmt ./...` - Formatted
- `go vet ./...` - No issues
- `go test -v ./...` - All tests passing

## Repository State

### Current Branch
- `main` - All work committed (by user)

### Recommended Next Steps for User
1. Review all created files
2. Install ThreeHats module in local FoundryVTT
3. Configure API key in FoundryVTT
4. Consider creating `develop` branch
5. Optionally enable GitHub Actions workflows
6. Begin Phase 1 implementation (WebSocket transport)

### Workflows Status
All GitHub Actions workflows are **disabled** (manual trigger only). This allows you to:
- Review and customize workflows
- Test them manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Enable automatic triggers when ready

To enable:
```yaml
# Edit .github/workflows/*.yml and uncomment:
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Version**: Started at v0.0.0-pre to indicate pre-release
2. **Workflows**: Manual trigger only to prevent accidental runs
3. **Branch Strategy**: Documented but not enforced yet (single-user project)
4. **Coverage Threshold**: 80% enforced in CI pipeline
5. **Multi-platform**: CI tests on Linux, Windows, macOS
6. **Release Strategy**: Automatic pre-release detection for v0.x.x

## Documentation Complete

All documentation is now in place:
- ✓ README.md - Project overview and quick start
- ✓ AGENTS.md - Development guidelines (14 sections)
- ✓ TODO.md - 10-phase roadmap (514 lines)
- ✓ PROTOCOL.md - Complete WebSocket protocol (401 lines)
- ✓ QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Common operations guide
- ✓ DEPENDENCIES.md - Dependency specification
- ✓ RESEARCH.md - Research findings (3 sessions)
- ✓ BRANCHING.md - Git workflow and strategy
- ✓ CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- ✓ STATUS.md - Current project status
- ✓ LICENSE - MIT License

## What's Next

### Phase 1: Core Client Infrastructure
The next major tasks are:
1. Add WebSocket library (gorilla/websocket or x/net/websocket)
2. Add UUID library (google/uuid)
3. Implement `internal/transport/websocket.go`
4. Implement `internal/protocol/messages.go`
5. Wire transport into `Client.Connect()`
6. Test against live FoundryVTT instance

### Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- First functional API (Phase 2): 2-4 weeks
- v0.1.0 release: 8-13 weeks

## Notes

- All code follows AGENTS.md guidelines
- No emoji in source code (as requested)
- Git operations left to user (as requested)
- Pure Go maintained (no CGO)
- Test coverage exceeds requirements
- Ready for active development
